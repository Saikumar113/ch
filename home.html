<h1>Car</h1>

<p>A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels,
and mainly transport people rather than goods. A car is a vehicle that has wheels, carries a small number of passengers, and is moved by an engine or a motor. Cars are also called
automobiles or motor vehicles. Trucks and buses are motor vehicles as well. However, trucks and buses are larger than cars, and they carry heavier loads.It is hard for anyone today to
imagine what life was like before there were cars. Cars and other motor vehicles have made it easy for people to travel within a city or across a continent. They have also influenced
where people live. People once had to live near their jobs, but now they can live farther away and drive to work.Yet cars and other motor vehicles have brought problems as well.
Tens of thousands of people are killed or injured each year in traffic accidents. Cities are often congested with huge traffic jams.
And gasoline is a limited resource that pollutes the atmosphere when burned as fuel.</p>

<pa>The first true automobile was a machine that had three wheels and was powered by steam. It was built by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot of France in 1769. It was heavy and moved very slowly.
Many manufacturers produced steam-driven automobiles during the late 1890s and early 1900s. A disadvantage of steam was that water had to be brought to a boil before the car could go.
During this same period other manufacturers produced cars run by electric motors. Electric cars ran smoothly and were easy to operate. However, they did not run well at high speeds..</pa>
